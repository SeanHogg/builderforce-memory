/**
 * wordLexicon — a compact, zero-dependency lexicon + language guard used by the text
 * coherence gate to catch the ONE failure mode the structural checks cannot see: an
 * under-trained byte-BPE head emitting fluent-SHAPED prose made of INVENTED WORDS that
 * balances its punctuation and never repeats itself ("…oredionisiing chats code related
 * tot, bound reposea this inatic exie. The cainstiel.ts, ore…").
 *
 * Every structural signal (repetition, dominant-token collapse, replacement chars,
 * orphaned delimiters) is blind to that text, and — measured on real samples —
 * no dictionary-free feature separates it: long-token share, type-token ratio and
 * character-cluster anomalies all score German/technical prose *worse* than the
 * gibberish. So this module supplies the missing signal: **is this token a word?**
 *
 * Three deliberate design constraints, because a false positive here silently drops a
 * legitimate reply:
 *
 *  1. **Language guard.** The lexicon is English-only, so it is consulted ONLY when the
 *     text is Latin-script AND English wins the function-word vote against es/fr/de/pt/it.
 *     A Spanish, French, German or Chinese reply is never judged by it. See
 *     {@link detectLatinLanguage}.
 *  2. **Small lexicon + generous escapes.** ~2.5k high-frequency stems (plus suffix
 *     stripping) can't possibly cover domain jargon, so a token also counts as known
 *     when it REPEATS in the text or appears in the caller's context (the prompt/question).
 *     Real jargon echoes the question or recurs; invented gibberish words are each
 *     different — that asymmetry is the observed signature.
 *  3. **Code is excluded, not judged.** Identifiers, paths, URLs, numbers and fenced
 *     blocks are stripped before scoring — they are legitimately non-words.
 *
 * Zero-dep and pure (no db/env/engine imports) so it can sit under `textCoherence`,
 * which every surface imports.
